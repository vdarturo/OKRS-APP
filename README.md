# ORKs App

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are a quarterly goal-setting framework for companies to drive growth, innovation, and improvement. OKRs focus on the most important areas that need improvement and help you deliver valuable outcomes for the business. 

OKRs are based on two essential elements:

- The Objective is a qualitative goal that defines what you want to improve.
- The Key Results are business outcomes that specify how you’ll know if you have progressed towards the Objective.

Two other crucial elements of the OKR process are Initiatives and Weekly Check-ins — the ways you actually drive your OKRs and track the progress:

- The Initiatives include all the projects and plans that will help you achieve your Team Objectives, 
- The Weekly Check-ins drive your OKRs forward by focusing your attention on what you need to do during one week.
